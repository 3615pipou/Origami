# origami math

## graph.h

this is an undirected graph data structure; the foundation of a representation of an origami crease pattern.

## planarGraph.h / .cpp

this is a subclass of the undirected graph structure, it adds the concept of 2D space. Nodes and Edges exist on a 2D plane, and many origami related functions can be implemented.
